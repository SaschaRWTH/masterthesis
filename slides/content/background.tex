\begin{frame}{Quantum Control Flow}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The idea of Quantum Control Flow was first used by \cite{AlGr05} to define function quantum programming language.
        \item For example, it was used to define the Hadamard gate as the function $had$:  
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{align*}
        had : Q& \to Q\\
        had : x \mapsto& \texttt{ if}^\circ x\\
                       & \texttt{ then } \{false \mid -true\}\\
                       & \texttt{ else } \{false \mid true\}
    \end{align*}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Later, the concept was formally defined by \cite{YYF12}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Limitations}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Quantum control flow is mainly limited by two principles: \emph{reversibility} and \emph{synchronization}.
    \end{itemize}
