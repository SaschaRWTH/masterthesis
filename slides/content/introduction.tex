\begin{frame}{Introduction}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Idea of Quantum control flow first used by \cite{AlGr05}.
        \item Later, it was defined by \cite{YYF12}.
        \item Most languages focus on classical control flow.
        \item Only recently, Quantum Control Machine, proposed by \cite{YVC24}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item An instruction set architecture.
            \item Allows for quantum control flow with an assembly-like syntax.
            \item Low-level design of the architecture and syntax $\to$ complex programs.
        \end{itemize}
        \item[$\Rightarrow$] Build upon the ideas, define a high-level quantum language with quantum control flow.
        \item[$\Rightarrow$] Plan to implement a compiler for it.
    \end{itemize}
