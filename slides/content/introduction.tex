\begin{frame}{Introduction}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The idea of quantum control flow was first used by \cite{AlGr05}.
        \item Later, it was defined by \cite{YYF12}.
        \item Nevertheless, most quantum languages focus on classical control flow with quantum data.
        \item Only recently, the Quantum Control Machine was proposed by \cite{YVC24}.
        \item It is an instruction set architecture allowing for quantum control flow with an assembly-like syntax.
        \item However, the low-level design of the architecture and syntax results in complex programs.
        \item In turn, we want to build upon the ideas and define a high-level quantum language with quantum control flow.
        \item Furthermore, we also want to implement a compiler for it.
