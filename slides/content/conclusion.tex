\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Multiple aspects that can be improved.
        \item Optimizations:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Focused on high-level optimizations $\to$ work best in tandem with other tools.
            \item Addition of hardware-focused features and transpilation to concrete devices.
            \item Improve performance of optimization stage by parallelization of wire traversals.
            \item Increases complexity of program, \eg, race conditions need to be considered.
        \end{itemize}
        \item General improvements:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Addition of type casting for the named constants.
            \item Expansion of predefined function; addition of constants, \eg, $\pi$ or $e$.
            \item Addition of explicit measurement. 
        \end{itemize}
