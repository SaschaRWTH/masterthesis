\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The evaluation revealed aspects that can be improved.
        \item The optimizations are focused on high-level optimizations and work best in tandem with other tools.
        \item A possible improvement is the addition of hardware-focused features and transpilation to concrete devices.
        \item Additionally, the performance of the optimization stage could be improved by parallelization of the wire traversals.
        \item However, this would increase the complexity of the program as, \eg, race conditions need to be considered.
        \item Other general improvements could be the addition of type casting for the named constants.
        \item Furthermore, the predefined function could be expanded, and constants such as $\pi$ or $e$ could be added.
        \item Lastly, explicit measurements could be added.
