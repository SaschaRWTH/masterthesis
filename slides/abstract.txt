Most quantum programming languages focus on quantum data with classical control flow. The recently proposed Quantum Control Machine is an instruction set architecture with a focus on quantum control flow. However, the assembly-like syntax and inherent limitations result in complex programs. In turn, we formally define the high-level quantum programming language "Luie" with control flow primitives in superposition and its translation to the existing quantum programming language OpenQASM. Furthermore, we implement a corresponding compiler with all steps from the lexical, syntactic, and semantic analysis to the code generation and optimization of the generated code.
