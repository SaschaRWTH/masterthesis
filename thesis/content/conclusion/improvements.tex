\section{Improvements and Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Evaluation showed some parts that can be improved
    \item Optimization improvements
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Currently focused more on high level optimizations, works great in tandem with Qiskit
        \item However compiler does not provide important functionalities such as transpilation 
        \item Does not translate to concrete hardware or devices
        \item In turn, has no hardware specific optimization rules
    \end{itemize} 
    \item Besides the optimizations applied, also showed that optimization stage inefficient for large number of gates and qubits
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In turn, need to optimize optimization algorithm
        \item Can, for example, parallelize the iteration over all qubit
        \item However, algorithm will become more complex, as race condition need to be accounted for
        \item Meaning, circuit needs to be lock when being changed
        \item Requires, eg atomic circuit operations or locks
    \end{itemize}
    \item additional improvement that were not considered in the evaluation
    \item were not focus of project but can improve useability of compiler 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Language
        \begin{itemize}
            \item What are possible improvements to language?
            \item More robust type system
            \item More functions and features
            \item Explicit measurements?
        \end{itemize}
        \item Optimization
        \begin{itemize}
            \item What are possible improvements to optimization?
            \item Parallelize optimizations on qubit wires (however increases complexity, as race conditions need to be considered)
        \end{itemize}
        \item General compiler improvements
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Add ability to transpile to basis gate set
            \item Allows for more targeted optimizations
            \item Can be use full to compile to specific languages
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
