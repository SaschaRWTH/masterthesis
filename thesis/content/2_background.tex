\chapter{Background}
\label{ch:background}
In the following section, we introduce and discuss different concepts that are referenced in later parts of this thesis. Firstly, we give a general introduction into quantum computing with some basic background knowledge on how quantum computers work, which quantum mechanical principles are essential for them, and some more specific knowledge about quantum algorithms and optimizations. Next, we discuss quantum control flow in more detail; it includes the formal definitions and its limitations. Then, we review existing quantum programming languages in general and some specific examples. Lastly, we give an overview on the topic of compilation and the different phases of a compiler.
