\chapter{Background}
\label{ch:background}
In the following section, we introduce and discuss different concepts that are reference in later parts of this thesis. Firstly, we give a general introduction into quantum computing with some basic background knowledge on how quantum computers work, which quantum mechanical principles are essential for them, and some more specific knowledge about quantum algorithms and optimizations. Next, we discuss quantum control flow in more detail. This includes the formal definitions and its limitations. Then, we review existing quantum programming languages in general and some specific examples. Lastly, we give an overview of compilation and its different steps.
