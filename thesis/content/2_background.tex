\chapter{Background}
\label{ch:background}
In the following section, we introduce and discuss different concepts that are referenced in later parts of this thesis. Firstly, we give a general introduction into quantum computing with some basic background knowledge on how quantum computers work and which quantum mechanical principles are essential for them. Additionally, we discuss more specific knowledge about quantum algorithms and optimization techniques for quantum circuits. Next, we discuss quantum control flow in more detail; this includes the formal definitions and its limitations. Then, we review existing quantum programming languages in general and some specific examples. Lastly, we give an overview of the topic of compilation and the different phases of a compiler.
