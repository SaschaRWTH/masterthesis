\section{Optimization}
\subsection{Constant folding}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Inherent in the language
    \item All variables known at compile time
    \item Any expression is evaluated at compile time
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Peephole optimization}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Not implemented, but planed
    \item Replace sequences of gates with more efficient ones
\end{itemize}
