\chapter{Concept}
In this chapter, we give a high-level overview of the different concepts and features of our proposed programming language ``Luie'' and the corresponding compiler. We also discuss some of the design decisions and draw comparisons to other programming languages targeting quantum computers. 

We start off with an overview of the language. This includes the overall structure, the different data types and statements, and some special behaviors. Next, we discuss the error handling of the compiler. There, we introduce and explain all possible warnings and critical errors that can occur. The error handling is followed by the discussion of the optimizations that the compiler may apply to the code; this includes some inherent optimizations as well as optional peephole optimizations. Lastly, we discuss the command line interface of the compiler, its options and their corresponding behavior.
