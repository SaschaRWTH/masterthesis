\chapter{Concept}
In this chapter, we give a high-level overview of the different concepts and feature provided by our proposed programming language Luie and the corresponding compiler. Furthermore, we discuss some of the design decision and draw comparisons to other quantum languages. 

We start of with an overview of the language. This includes the overall structure, the different data types and statements, and some special behavior. Next, we discuss the error handling of the compiler. There, we introduce and explain all possible warnings and critical errors that can error. The error handling is followed by the discussion of the optimizations that the compiler may apply to the code; this includes some inherent optimizations as well as optional peephole optimizations. Lastly, we discuss the command line interface of the compiler, its options and their corresponding behavior.
