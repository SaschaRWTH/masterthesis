\chapter{Concept}
After the discussion of the background of quantum computing in general, quantum control flow and programming language, and the compilation of programs, in this chapter, we present a concept for the quantum programming language ``Luie'' with control flow primitives, based on the ideas of the Quantum Control Machine. After an informal description, we define both the syntax of the language and translation functions from the source language to the target language OpenQASM.  
% Next, we discuss some general concepts for the compiler, starting with the error handling. There, we introduce and explain all possible warnings and critical errors that can occur. The error handling is followed by the discussion of the optimizations that the compiler may apply to the code; this includes some inherent optimizations as well as optional peephole optimizations. 
Next, we present the different optimizations that are applied by the compiler. Additionally, we give a theoretical overview of the graphical abstraction that is used to optimize the program.
Lastly, we discuss the command line interface of the compiler, its options and their corresponding behavior.
