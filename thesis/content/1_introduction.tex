\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduction into Quantum Computing, Quantum Languages, (possibly compilation)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Short history on quantum computer
        \item Technology improving
        \item Practical QC becoming more realistic, technology may be viable on small scales in near future
        \item Possible impact of quantum computers
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Can solve certain problems fast than classical computer
            \item Effect of cryptography, \dots
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item What is the motivation for the thesis
    \begin{itemize}
        \item With the emergence of quantum computing, many quantum languages were introduced. 
        \item Most languages focus on a lower level representation of quantum circuits. (QASM)\cite{CBSG17}.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item QASM consists mainly of quantum and classical gates that can be manipulated by predefined and composite gates as well as limited classical if-statements. 
            \item In contrast, there are also languages with a focus on high level interactions, e.g. Tower\cite{ChMi22} which contains data structures in superposition, and Silq~\cite{BBGV20} which allows for automatic uncomputing of registers.
        \end{itemize}
        \item  What all these languages have in common is the restriction to quantum data while using only classical control flow.
        \item Quantum Control Flow Although quantum control flow was defined by Ying et al.~\cite{YYF12} over ten years ago, only very few languages have incorporated the principle.
        \item recently: Quantum Control Machine (QCM)~\cite{YVC24} with quantum control flow at its core 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item contains multiple restrictions
            \item hard to program in, \eg need to ensure synchronization
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item What is the thesis goal
    \begin{itemize}
        \item take ideas of QCM and design high-level language with same capabilities
        \item Implement compiler that translates language to OpenQASM
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
