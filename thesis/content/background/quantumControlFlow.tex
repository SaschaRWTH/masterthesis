\section{Quantum Control Flow}
\label{sec:background_quantumControlFlow}
The idea of quantum control flow was first used by Altenkirch et al.~\cite{AlGr05} when defining a functional programming language with quantum control flow elements. The language uses an if-statement in superposition, $\texttt{if}^\circ$, which is used to, e.g., defined the Hadamard gate as a function $had$ instead of a matrix. The $had$ function takes a qubit as an input. If the qubit is true, i.e. the value is one, the function returns a uniform superposition of true and false, where true has a negative sign. Correspondingly, for a false input, a uniform superposition with both signs positive is returned.
\begin{align*}
    had : Q& \to Q\\
    had : x \mapsto& \texttt{ if}^\circ x\\
                   & \texttt{ then } \{false \mid -true\}\\
                   & \texttt{ else } \{false \mid true\}
\end{align*}
Quantum control flow can be divided into \emph{quantum branching} and \emph{iteration}~\cite{YVC24}. In the following, we will discuss both branching and iteration in superposition as well as the limitations of quantum control flow. 

\subsection{Branching}
\label{sec:background_branching}
Based on the work presented by Altenkirch et al.~\cite{AlGr05}, the concept of quantum control flow, more specifically quantum branching, was expanded on and formally defined by Ying et al.~\cite{YYF12}. They introduce two different types of quantum branching, quantum guarded commands, and quantum choices as a special case of guarded commands. The definition of quantum guarded commands is based on Dijkstra's guarded commands~\cite{Dijk75}. Guarded commands concern the nondeterministic executing of functions based on Boolean expressions, where the nondeterminism derives from the possible overlapping of the guards. In contrast, quantum branching allows for execution of functions based on a value in superposition. The functions are executed such that the result may be a superposition of the results of the individual functions~\cite{YVC24}.
Quantum branching is, e.g., used in simulation algorithms like \cite{BGB*18}, and \cite{LoCh19}.

The formal definition for classical guarded commands is given by:
\begin{equation*}
    \square^n_{i=1} b_i \to C_i
\end{equation*}
where $C_i$ is a command guarded by a Boolean expression $b_i$. The command can only be executed if the expression is true. Similarly, quantum guarded commands map to a set of quantum programs $P_i$. Further, a set of qubits or quantum registers, which are not used in any guarded program $P_i$, and a corresponding orthogonal basis $\ket{i}$ is given. The resulting quantum guarded command is of the following form:\unsure{can give better/more indepth explantation, example?}
\begin{equation*}
    \square^n_{i=1} \bar{q}, \ket{i} \to P_i.
\end{equation*} 
The quantum programs are guarded by the basis states and the control flow results from the superposition of these basis states~\cite{YYF12}. 

\subsection{Iteration}
\label{sec:background_iteration}
Quantum iteration can be implemented either as quantum recursion or quantum loops. While some languages implement loops based on the measurement of qubits or registers~\cite{Ying11}, the concept of quantum iteration requires the body of the loop to be executed in superposition based on the guard in superposition~\cite{YYF12}.\unsure{reference~\cite{FYY13}?}

While classical iteration takes an operation and repeats it on a classical register for $k$ iterations, quantum iteration is dependent on a value $k'$ in superposition and, correspondingly, return a quantum register in superposition. Moreover, it is a special case of quantum branching and heavily restricted by the limitations of quantum computers~\cite{YVC24}.    

\subsection{Limitations}
\label{sec:background_limitations}	
While quantum control flow is often based on the corresponding control flow primitives on classical computers, it is restricted by multiple limitations imposed by quantum computers. Therefore, many control flow primitives that are used in classical programs can either by not used at all or in a limited capacity. There are two main limitations for quantum programs. Firstly, all gate-based quantum computers need to adhere to \emph{reversibility}. Secondly, programs need to follow the \emph{synchronization} principle for them to return any useful results~\cite{YVC24}.

\subsubsection{Reversibility}
\label{sec:background_controlflow_reversibility}
As introduced in Sec.~\ref{sec:background_quantumGates}, any sequence of instructions on gate-based quantum computers, excluding measurements, is required to be reversible by definition, as they are all unitary transformations. Therefore, any quantum control flow is also required to adhere to this principle. A resulting limitation, that is not present on classical computer, is that any guards for guarded commands need to be immutable in the commands themselves. For example, if a qubit's state is flipped when its value is $0$, the resulting command will always return value of $1$. When a program returns the same result regardless of which statements where executed, the program cannot be reversible. \improvement{Also inherint in definition of quantum branching~\cite{YYF12}}   
Moreover, control flow, as implemented in classical computers, is also not possible. At a basic level, modern computers use jump and conditional jump instruction to implement branching and loop. However, any classical jump instruction is inherently irreversible. Not only can a jump go to a section of code that is accessible without any jumps, multiple jumps can also lead to the same line of code. Therefore, the a reversed program cannot know which path would be or was taken in original program~\cite{YVC24}.  

A simple solution seems to be offered by the \emph{Landauer Embedding}~\cite{Land61}. Fundamentally, the idea of the embedding is to turn a now reversible function into a reversible one by not only returning the output but also the input of the function. For example, for a domain $D$ and a codomain $D'$, any (non-)reversible function $f : D \to D'$ can be given as a reversible function $g : D \to D' \times D$ with $g(x) = (f(x), x)$. In the case a quantum program with, e.g., jump instructions, this would result in an output of the result and a complete history of which path was taken through the program. However, because the quantum data depends on the program history, they become entangled. This leads to disruptive entanglement, as described in Sec.~\ref{sec:background_entanglement}, causing invalid results~\cite{YVC24}. 


\subsubsection{Synchronization}
\label{sec:background_controlflow_synchronization}
As we have previously seen, reversibility alone is not the only limiting factor on quantum control flow. When handling control flow, similar to the classical implementation, with a program counter in superposition, the program counter can become entangled with the data and result in disruptive entanglement leading to an invalid result. To avoid this issue, the program must not only be reversible but also adhere the the principle of \emph{synchronization}. It states that control flow must become independent from the data. Further, because any quantum program needs to be synchronized to return any useful results, while loops dependent on a value in superposition need to be bound by a classical value~\cite{YVC24}.
