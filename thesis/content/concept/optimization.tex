While it is possible to directly apply optimizations to the program code or internal representation of that code, this approach can be tedious and error prone. For example, the easiest approach would be to iterate over the code and search for code sequences with more efficient but equivalent alternatives, similar to the peephole optimization pattern on classical computers presented in Sec.~\ref{sec:background_codeOptimization}. However, two consecutive gates operating on a single wire may be separated by multiple gate applications on different wires in the programmatic description. 
% An example of this is depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:circuit_graph_unoptimized_code}. Here, a register with 3 qubits is initiated an  gate are applied to it. While the first two gates applied to the third qubit are are two Hadamard gates, they are separated by two gate applications in the code itself.
Therefore, many simple optimization rules may not be applied when using a simplistic algorithm. A more complex approach would be too subdivide the program into lists of gate application where the wires being operated on by each list are disjunct. While this approach can result in the application of more optimization rules, it will also miss possible applications and already requires a complex implementation. Furthermore, improving on this method only increases its complexity and, in turn, makes it more prone to errors. Therefore, the language does not directly apply the optimizations to the program but uses a circuit graph description, based on the graph described by Kreppel et al.~\cite{KMO*23}, to apply the optimizations.

The circuit graph is a graphical description of a quantum graph; it is a acyclic and directed graph. For each qubit in the circuit, there exist both an input node and an output node. Furthermore, each input node as exactly one outgoing vertex while each output node as exactly one incoming vertex. Besides the input and output nodes, all other nodes represent gates in the circuit. All gate nodes the number of incoming vertices is equivalent to the number of outgoing vertices. Additionally, the number of incoming, or outgoing, vertices is the same as the number of parameters of the gate. Importantly, in this case, any qubits controlling the application of the gate, \eg the first qubit in a controlled-not gate, do also count to the number of parameters. In turn, their exists a vertices pair of an incoming and outgoing vertex each that represent a qubit to which the gate is applied. Therefore, for each qubit, there exists one path from its input node to its output node such that all gates that are applied to it are visited in order of application.

\subsubsection{Graph Construction}
When using the circuit graph to optimize the quantum program, the first step is to systematically construct the graph from the program. The creation of the graph starts with the input and output nodes for each qubit in the circuit. For each declaration of a qubit in the program, a input and output node pair is created. If a register is declared, a pair is created separately for each qubit in the register, \ie for a register with size $n$, $n$ pairs are created in total. Next, the gate applications in the program can be iterated. For each gate application, a corresponding gate node is created. To insert this node into the graph, each qubit parameter requires an incoming vertex to this node and a corresponding outgoing vertex from the node. Additionally, the incoming node must come from the gate that was previously applied to the qubit or the input node if no gate was applied yet. Similarly, the outgoing gate must lead to the either the next applied gate or the corresponding output. Therefore, for each qubit, the vertex coming into the output node can be diverted to the gate node and an outgoing vertex from the gate to the output node can be created. Repeating this step for all gate applications in the program result in the circuit graph.  

An example of a simple, unoptimized circuit graph is depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:circuit_graph_unoptimized}. For simplicity, all applied gates are depicted in their corresponding node of the circuit graph. The circuit consist of three qubits, $q_0$, $q_1$, and $q_2$; their input and output nodes are depicted on the left and right of the graph respectively and are labeled with the corresponding qubit. Firstly, an $X$ is applied to the first qubit $q_0$. Than, a controlled-not gate is applied to the first two qubits $q_0$ and $q_1$, where $q_0$ is the controlling qubit. Simultaneously, two Hadamard gates $H$ are applied to the third qubit $q_2$. Lastly, another $X$ gate is applied to the first qubit $q_0$ while another controlled-not gate is applied to the second and third qubits $q_1$ and $q_2$. In this case, the second qubit $q_1$ is the controlling qubit.

\subsubsection{Graph Optimization}
The next step in the optimization process is the application of optimization rules, in this case peephole optimizations, to the circuit graph. To accomplish this, subgraphs of the graph need to be iterated systematically. Then, each subgraph is checked for an equivalent but more efficient or cost-effective alternative. If an alternative is found, the subgraph is replaced with it. In our case, we iterate over all possible subpaths of all qubit paths up to a certain length; this length depends on the maximum number of nodes that are affected by an optimization rule. A qubit path is a path that starts at the input node of a qubit and ends in the corresponding output node. Furthermore, it visits only the nodes corresponding to the gates that are applied to the qubit in the correct order. However, optimizing parts of the circuit may enable further optimizations. For example, after removing a gate combination, two previously separated Hadamard gates may now represent a null gate combination which can, in turn, also be removed. Therefore, the process needs to be repeated until no more optimizations were applied.

An example for this is the optimization process of the circuit graph depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:circuit_graph_unoptimized}. Firstly, subpaths for the qubit path of the first qubit $q_0$ are iterated. Here, the subpath of node it the path with the first two gate nodes $X$ and $CX$. Since the $X$ node the child of the input node, we know that the value of the qubit will be $\ket{1}$ after the application. Therefore, we know that the controlled-not gate will always apply the $X$ gate to the second qubit $q_1$ and we can replace the $CX$ gate node with a simple $X$ node that is only visited by the second qubit's path. For simplicity, we assume that the optimizations are only applied after all subpaths are iterated such that there are no optimization that can be applied to the second qubit in this round of the optimizations. However, in out later implementation, the optimizations are applied while iterating over the circuit. Lastly, on the third qubit wire, there are two consecutive Hadamard gates that can be removed. Overall, the first round of optimizations results in the circuit graph depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:circuit_graph_first_optimized}. 
 
\begin{figure}[htp]

    \begin{minipage}{.6\textwidth}
        \centering     
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../figures/circuit_graph_optimized_firststep.pdf}
        \caption{Circuit graph after the first optimization.}
        \label{fig:circuit_graph_first_optimized}
    \end{minipage}
    \hfill
    \begin{minipage}{.35\textwidth}
        \centering     
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../figures/circuit_graph_optimized_complete.pdf}
        \caption{Completely optimized graph.}
        \label{fig:circuit_graph_optimized_complete}
    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

In the next optimization round, the two $X$ gates on the first qubit wire are now applied consecutively. Therefore, they can both be removed from the circuit. Finally, the combination of an $X$ gate child of an input node followed by a controlled-not gate can, again, be optimized such that the $CX$ gate is replaced with a simple $X$ gate on the third qubit wire. The result is a circuit where the first qubit remains unchanged and only an $X$ gate is applied to the second and third qubit. This result is also depicted in Fig~\ref{fig:circuit_graph_optimized_complete}.   

\subsubsection{Graph Translation}
After all possible optimizations rules were applied and no others were enabled in turn, the only remaining step is to translate the circuit graph back to a programmatic description. The qubits for the circuit are easily declared by iterating over all input or output node. Additionally, the qubit count can be reduced by leaving out all qubits where the output node is the child of the input node after the optimization. In the case of the optimized circuit, depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:circuit_graph_optimized_complete}, the first qubit $q_0$ can be skipped when adding the declaration to the translated program. 

For the gate applications, the only requirement is that, if a gate node is a descendent of another, its translated gate application statement must come after the statement of the ancestor node. Therefore, for most circuit graph there are multiple possible programs describing the circuit correctly. For example, when translating the completely optimized graph described above, the order of the $X$ gate applications to both the second and third qubit is irrelevant such that both possibilities, \ie either applying the gate to $q_1$ or $q_2$ first, are valid translations of the program. Furthermore, while iterating over all input or output nodes and adding the corresponding qubit and register declarations to the beginning of the program is the easiest approach, the order and placement of the declarations is also arbitrary as long as they are declared before their first use.
