\section{Language Overview}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Given an overview of the different feature of the language\
    \item How do they work and what is the reason for implementing them
    \item Why are some feature (\eg implicit iteration) \emph{not} implemented
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Blocks and Scopes}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Basic structure of Luie
    \item Consists of blocks and statements
    \item One main block
    \item Symbol table that handles scopes
    \item All blocks have scope 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Types}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Different data types
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Register
        \item Qubits (Registers with size 1)
        \item Iterators, in more detail in Sec.~\ref{sec:control_flow}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Gate Application}

\subsection{Control Flow}
\label{sec:control_flow}

\subsection{Expressions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Consists of expressions, terms and factors
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Expressions consist of expression, operator, and term or just a term
        \item Term consists of term, operator, and factor or just a factor
        \item Factor consists of expression in parentheses, a negated factor, number, identifier or function call
    \end{itemize}
    \item Inherent order of operations
\end{itemize}
