\section{Syntax}
\label{sec:concept_abstractGrammar}
The syntax of our programming language $Luie$ is defined by the context-free grammar $CFG_{Luie}$. It consists of a set of non-terminals $V_{Luie}$, terminals $\Sigma_{Luie}$, and grammar rules $R_{Luie}$ as well as the start symbol $prg_{Luie}$. The terminal symbol $n$ represents a natural number, while $id$ represents an identifier. The grammar rules $R_{Luie}$ are discussed in the following.
\begin{align*}
    CFG_{Luie} = \ & \{V_{Luie}, \Sigma_{Luie}, R_{Luie}, prg \}\\ 
    V_{Luie} = \ & \{ exp, rExp, gate, cGate, qArg stm,\\ 
            & \ \  dcl, gDcl, blk, t, prg\}\\ 
    \Sigma_{Luie} = \ & \{n, id, \texttt{..}, \texttt{range}, \texttt{(}, \texttt{)}, \texttt{+}, \texttt{-}, \\
               & \ \ \texttt{x}, \texttt{y}, \texttt{z}, \texttt{cx}, \texttt{ccx}, \texttt{[}, \texttt{]}, \dots \} \quad \quad \texttt{where } n \in \mathbb{N}, id \in Identifier
\end{align*}

The grammar contains two different kinds of expression rules, the arithmetic expression rule $exp$ and the range expression rule $rExp$.
\begin{align*}
    Expression: \ & exp ::= n \mid id \mid exp_1 \texttt{ + } exp_2 \mid exp_1 \texttt{ - } exp_2 \mid exp_1 \texttt{ * } exp_2 \mid \dots\\
    RangeExpression: \ & rExp ::= n_1 .. n_2 \mid \texttt{range(} exp \texttt{)} \mid \texttt{range(} exp_1, exp_2 \texttt{)}\\
\end{align*}

Three grammar rules that are used in the context of gate applications are the gate, constant gate, and qubit argument rules, $gate$, $cGate$, and $qArg$ respectively. The gate rule allows for the application of either a composite gate, given by an identifier, or a constant gate, given explicitly. Similarly, the qubit argument rule allows for either a qubit, specified by an identifier, or a register access, specified by an identifier and expression. Lastly, the constant gate rule simply allows for all predefined gates. 
\begin{align*}
    Gate: \ & gate ::= id \mid cGate\\
    ConstGate: \ & cGate ::= \texttt{x} \mid \texttt{y} \mid \texttt{z} \mid \texttt{cx} \mid \texttt{ccx}\\
    QubitArgument: \ & qArg ::= id \mid id[exp]\\
\end{align*}

Next, the declaration rules $dcl$ and $gDcl$ are used to declare qubits, register, or constant variables and gate declaration respectively. Each requires an identifier given by the $id$ rule. In the case of the constant and register declaration, the value and size are given by an expression. Additionally, the gate declaration requires a list of identifiers for the arguments and the code block of the composite gate.
\begin{align*}
    Declaration: \ & dcl ::= \texttt{const } id \texttt{ = } exp \texttt{;} \mid \\
                 & \quad \quad \quad \quad \texttt{qubit } id \texttt{;} \mid \\
                 & \quad \quad \quad \quad \texttt{qubit[} exp \texttt{] } id \texttt{;}\\
    GateDeclaration: \ & gDcl::= \texttt{gate } id \texttt{ (}id_1, \dots, id_n\texttt{) do } blk \texttt{ end}\\
\end{align*}

The statement rule $stm$ can either be an if-statement, with an optional else-block, a loop statement, a gate application statement, or a skip statement. The qubit argument rule is used for both the if-statement, to specify the control qubit, and the gate application statement, to specify the arguments. Additionally, the range expression is used to specify the range of the loop-statement. The block rule is used for the body of the if-statement, the optional else-block, and the loop statement.
\begin{align*}
    Statement: \ & stm ::= \texttt{qif } qArg \texttt{ do }  blk \texttt{ end} \mid\\
                 & \quad \quad \quad \quad \texttt{qif } qArg \texttt{ do }  blk_1 \texttt{ else } blk_2 \texttt{ end} \mid\\
                 & \quad \quad \quad \quad \texttt{for } id \texttt{ in } rExp \texttt{ do } blk \texttt{ end} \mid \\
                 & \quad \quad \quad \quad gate \ qArg_1, \dots, qArg_n \texttt{;} \mid \\
                 & \quad \quad \quad \quad \texttt{skip;}\\
\end{align*}

The last grammar rules are the block rule $blk$, which specifies a possibly empty list of translatables, the translatable rule $t$, which can either be a statement or declaration, and the program rule $prg$, which consists of an optional list of gate declarations and a code block. 
\begin{align*}
    Block: \ & blk::= t_1 \dots t_n \mid \epsilon\\
    Translatable : \ & t::= stm \mid dcl\\
    Program: \ & prg ::= gDcl_1 \dots gDcl_n \ blk \mid blk 
\end{align*}

Since we define some auxiliary functions that operate on OpenQASM code, a reduced grammar for the OpenQASM programming language is given by $CFG_{QASM}$. It consists of a set of non-terminals $V_{QASM}$, terminals $\Sigma_{QASM}$, and grammar rules $R_{QASM}$ as well as the start symbol $prg_{QASM}$. Some of the terminals and non-terminals in the grammar are the same as in the source code grammar $CFG_{Luie}$. In these cases, the definition of the grammar rules also the same; all other grammar rules are discussed in the following.
\begin{align*}
    CFG_{QASM} = \ & \{V_{QASM}, \Sigma, R_{QASM}, p \}\\ 
    V_{QASM} = \ & \{ cGate, qArg, gateApp, qubitDcl, qStm,\\ 
            & \ \  qasm, p \}\\ 
    \Sigma_{QASM} = \ & \{n, id, \texttt{ctrl}, \texttt{negctrl}, \texttt{(}, \texttt{)}, \\
               & \ \ \texttt{x}, \texttt{y}, \texttt{z}, \texttt{cx}, \texttt{ccx}, \texttt{[}, \texttt{]}, \dots \} \quad \quad \texttt{where } n \in \mathbb{N}, id \in Identifier
\end{align*}

\dots
\begin{align*}
    QubitDeclaration: \ & qubitDcl::= \texttt{qubit } id \texttt{;} \mid\\
    & \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \texttt{qubit[}n\texttt{] } id \texttt{;}\\
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
GateApplication: \ & gateApp::= cGate \ a_1, ..., a_n \texttt{;} \mid\\
& \quad \quad \quad \texttt{ctrl(}n\texttt{)} \texttt{ @ } qGate \ a_1, ..., a_n \texttt{;} \mid\\
& \quad \quad \quad \texttt{negctrl(}n\texttt{)} \texttt{ @ } qGate \ a_1, ..., a_n \texttt{;} \mid\\
    & \quad \quad \quad \texttt{ctrl(}n_1\texttt{)} \texttt{ @ } \texttt{negctrl(}n_2\texttt{)} \texttt{ @ } qGate \ a_1, ..., a_n \texttt{;}\\
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
    QASMStatement: \ & qStm::= gateApp \mid qubitDcl \mid \epsilon\\
    QASM: \ & qasm ::= qStm_1 \dots qStm_n\\
    QASMProgam: \ & p ::= \texttt{OPENQASM 3.0;}\\
            & \quad \quad \texttt{include "stdgates.inc";}\\
            & \quad \quad qasm
\end{align*}
