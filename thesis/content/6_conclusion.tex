\section{Improvements and Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Conclusion to thesis
    \item Future work
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Language
        \begin{itemize}
            \item What are possible improvements to language?
            \item More robust type system
            \item More functions and features
            \item Explicit measurements?
        \end{itemize}
        \item Optimization
        \begin{itemize}
            \item What are possible improvements to optimization?
            \item Parallelize optimizations on qubit wires (however increases complexity, as race conditions need to be considered)
        \end{itemize}
        \item General compiler improvements
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Add ability to transpile to basis gate set
            \item Allows for more targeted optimizations
            \item Can be use full to compile to specific languages
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
