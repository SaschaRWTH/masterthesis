\chapter{Introduction}

Quantum algorithms like Shor's algorithm~\cite{Shor97} could provide a significant improvement to classical algorithms given sufficient technology. Therefore, a lot of research is conducted in the area of Quantum Computing (QC). While there already exist detailed theoretical foundations for QC, the technology of quantum computers is said to be on the level of classical computer in the 1950s~\cite{CFM17}. Currently, there are many different architectures and ideas for the future of QC. In this proposal and the following thesis, we want to build upon the Quantum Control Machine proposed by Yuan et al.~\cite{YVC24} and discuss the idea of quantum control flow \improvement{What is quantum control flow? It is never explained} in general.

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Quantum Computer ability to solve (certain) algorithms faster than classical computers
%     \item e.g. Factorization
%     \item Therefore, a lot of research into quantum computers  
%     \item While detailed theoretical foundation
%     \item (Technology of) Quantum Computer on level with classical computer 1950s \cite{CFM17}.
%     \item Different architectures and ideas for future of QC
%     \item Want to build on recent proposal 

%     % \item Short intro into QC
