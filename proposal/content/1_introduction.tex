\chapter{Introduction}



\begin{itemize}
    \item Quantum Computer ability to solve (certain) algorithms faster than classical computers
    \item e.g. Factorization
    \item Therefore, a lot of research into quantum computers  
    \item While detailed theoretical foundation
    \item (Technology of) Quantum Computer on level with classical computer 1950s \cite{CFM17}.
    \item Different architectures and ideas for future of QC
    \item Want to build on recent proposal 

    % \item Short intro into QC
