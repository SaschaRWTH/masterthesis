\chapter{Concept}

The concept for the master thesis is to take the idea of the QCM, specifically the core concept of quantum control flow, and reduce it to its most basic elements and make it realistic for NISQ era quantum computers. Concretely, we want to from jump instructions to basic if-else clause to reduce the complexity of the code and make it easier to read and write. Moreover, because of the synchronization principle, any other loop can be reduced to a for-loop that is unrolled at compile time.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Idea \info{Explain in concept} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item reduce QCM to basics
        \item lead to concept section
    \end{itemize}
    \item Language features: qif-else, bounded loops, (boolean eval)
    \item Translation to quasm
    \item overall (more) realistic for NISQ 
    \item Further (compiler optimizations)
    \item Example grammar
