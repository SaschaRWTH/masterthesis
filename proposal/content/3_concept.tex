\chapter{Concept}

The concept for the master thesis is to take the idea of the QCM, specifically the core concept of quantum control flow, and reduce it to its most basic elements and make it realistic for NISQ era quantum computers. Concretely, we want to from jump instructions to basic if-else clause to reduce the complexity of the code and make it easier to read and write. Moreover, because of the synchronization principle, any other loop can be reduced to a for-loop that is unrolled at compile time.

To achieve this goal, we want to define a language "Luie" (short for loop-unrolled if-else) which is partially based on the quantum while language used by Ying~\cite{Ying11}. The language is extended by a quantum if clause which takes a quantum register and executes the statements in the clause based on the value of the register. This could even be extended to include boolean expression. While the language cannot include while statements based on measurements of registers, as it is the case in the language proposed by Ying, it can include bounded loops which are unrolled at compile time. The language will then be compiled to QASM. A basic grammar for the language can be seen in Appendix~\ref{appendix:grammar}.
