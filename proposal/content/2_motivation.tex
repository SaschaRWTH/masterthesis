    \item Classical control flow vs quantum control flow~\cite{YYF12}

With the emergence of quantum computing, many quantum languages were introduced. While some may focus on a lower level representation of quantum circuits and others on high level interactions, most language restrict themselves to only quantum data while using classical control flow. Although quantum control flow was defined by Ying et al.~\cite{YYF12} over 10 years ago, only recently was a language with quantum control flow at its core proposed by Yuan et al.~\cite{YVC24}. 

The so-called "Quantum Control Machine"  
\begin{itemize}
    \item bounded by reversibility and synchronicity
    \begin{itemize}
        \item what is reversibility, why is it needed
        \item what is synchronicity, why is it needed
    \end{itemize}
    \item based on classical assembly languages (jumps, registers, ...)
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Issues with qcm
    \item very unreadable
    \item can be reduced to basics
